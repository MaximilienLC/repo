Read @code\core\neuroevolution\MAIN.md and @code\core\neuroevolution\GOTCHAS.md. Do not read any other `.md` file. Implement a MVP where agents are only actors, have static architectures and optimize for total returns in CartPole. Do not investigate `amdsmi` warnings. Make sure the average fitness is improving. Absolutely make sure that no relevant specification is ignored, even when running into errors. After debugging, write down any new gotchas in @code\core\neuroevolution\GOTCHAS.md (don't forget to take into account existing ones). Do not run any tasks in the background.
