Read `@code\neuroevolution\----MAIN.md and @code\neuroevolution\-GOTCHAS.md`. Do not read any other `.md` file. Do not investigate `amdsmi` warnings. Make sure to have many tests to validate functionality. Absolutely make sure that no relevant specification is ignored, even when running into errors. After debugging, write down any new gotchas in `@code\neuroevolution\-GOTCHAS.md` (don't forget to take into account existing ones). Do not run any tasks in the background.
