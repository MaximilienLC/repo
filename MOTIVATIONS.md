# Motivations

## Summary

Every day, a large amount of people use ChatGPT for therapy and self-development. Common reasons for such use are the patience, agreeableness and virtually unlimited attention that ChatGPT can provide to its interlocutor. On the other hand, many agree that ChatGPT and its LLM siblings are not quite properly equipped to understand the human condition and assist with human flourishing.

This repository consistutes an attempt to bridge this gap.

---

No one is better equipped to understand the human condition than people themselves. However energy allocated towards that understanding (e.g. therapists, philosophers, ...) looks to me in short supply.

And while this could theoretically look to be a social societal challenge adressable independently of AI technology; it looks to me that AI technology is becoming so deeply embedded that putting it to the side could be an unnecessary slow-down in that pursuit. As a result, I hope to believe in a future where AI models, given more intricate human data and improved ways to model that data, become increasingly understanding.

## Practical assumptions

I believe that (in order of importance):

- "What I cannot create, I do not understand" (Richard Feynman).

    In order for an AI model to further understand human behaviour, I believe it needs to be able to better model it. As such, human behaviour imitation is of central interest in this repository.

- There is value to be found beyond deep learning.

    While there is likely a ceiling in terms of how close can computational methods accurately model behaviour, I reckon that deep learning alone cannot reach that ceiling. Theoretically, deep learning is bounded to the space of differentiable functions. Practically, it is further narrowed due to various baked-in assumptions and unfavourable data regimes.

    Theoretically, I believe that the perfect mix is a blend of every computational method that we have ever invented. Practically however, I believe evolutionary algorithms to be a good first fit to pair with deep learning. Theoretically, these algorithms are only bounded to the space of functions with comparable outputs. However, information from the data does not flow as abundantly as deep learning methods, making them scale worse to compute.

- There is value to be found beyond fixed neural network architecures.
