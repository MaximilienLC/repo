# Motivations

## Summary

Every day, a large amount of people use ChatGPT for therapy and self-development. Common reasons for such use are the patience, agreeableness and virtually unlimited attention that ChatGPT can provide to its interlocutor. On the other hand, many agree that ChatGPT and its LLM siblings are not quite properly equipped to understand the human condition and assist with human flourishing.

This repository consistutes our attempt to bridge this gap.

No one is better equipped to understand the human condition than people themselves. However energy allocated towards that understanding - from therapists, philosophers, people themselves ... - looks to us in short supply. Indeed, human flourishing has, in recent history, not been the path of least resistance for societal progress and the fruits it bears.

We understand that traditionally, such reality would rather be adressed through organic means, with techonology playing a supporting role that only stretches as far as it minimally needs to.

However times are changing, and our relationship with technology looks increasingly symbiotic.

In this codebase, we thus propose to research human flourishing assisting technology.

We propose to work on researching how to 1) make AI models more understanding of the human condition, and perhaps more importantly 2) make AI models more understanding of why they should assist in this venture.

## Roadmap

1. Behaviour modeling

"What I cannot create, I do not understand" - Richard Feynman

In order for an AI model to assist with the grand journey that is human flourishing, we believe it needs the deepest possible understanding of human behaviour; and we believe the best way to acquire this understanding is through its imitation.

2. Integration

Unprecedented value is currently being derived from ChatGPT-like models trained on internet textual data. This data represents the conversations that humanity has been having for the past decades. It is a gold mine of collective human interaction, knowledge and intelligence that has been made more portable.

We believe deeper understanding of societal and human flourishing to come through the succesful integration of both internet and human modeled components.

3. Flourishing alignment

Convincing ChatGPT-like models to act in a certain way is an art form in development. It currently constitutes in optimizing the model to be as likely as possible to say the "right" things. This optimization is of course not straightforward since the models are biased towards their underlying modeled internet discourse.

Regardless of whether this model alignment regime remains or converges towards more traditional human alignment, significant efforts need to be produced in order to understand the resulting behaviour and its basis.

We believe wisdom to be the most processed form of information, and we believe human wisdom to generally converge towards walking on a path to unconditional universal love.

We thus need to probe the agent's wisdom, and see whether it converges to the same conclusion. If not, we need to work on a compromise.
