# code

This directory contains the repository's codebase.

It is divided into two main subdirectories:
- @code/projects/, in which you will find project-specific directories (e.g. MNIST classification).
- @code/core/, in which you will find code that is likely to be reused across projects (e.g. a Deep Learning training loop).
