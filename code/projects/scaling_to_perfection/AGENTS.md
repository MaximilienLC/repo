# Scaling to Perfection

## Project Proposal

Scaling law experiments concern themselves with the evolution of a metric over several variables, such as dataset size, model size, etc.

In this project we aim to find scaling laws to perfection for behaviour cloning.

For each behaviour considered, we aim to put into place several metrics that characterize the target's behaviour.



We aim to explore the following methods:
