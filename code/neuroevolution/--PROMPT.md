Read `@code\neuroevolution\----MAIN.md` and `@code\neuroevolution\-GOTCHAS.md`. Do not read any other `.md` file. Do not investigate `amdsmi` warnings.

Implement a MVP where agents are only actors, have static architectures and optimize for total returns in CartPole. Make sure the average fitness is improving. Plot it.

Absolutely make sure that no relevant specification is ignored, even when running into errors. After debugging, write down any new gotchas in `@code\neuroevolution\-GOTCHAS.md` (don't forget to take into account existing ones). Do not run any tasks in the background.
