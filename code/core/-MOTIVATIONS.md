# Motivations

- There is value to be found beyond deep learning.

    While there is likely a ceiling in terms of how close can computational methods accurately model behaviour, we reckon that deep learning alone cannot reach that ceiling. Theoretically, deep learning is bounded to the space of differentiable functions. Practically, it is further narrowed due to various baked-in assumptions and unfavourable data regimes.

    Theoretically, we believe that the ceiling is reachable through a blend of every type of computational method that we have ever invented.
    
    Practically however, we believe evolutionary algorithms to be a good first fit to try and pair up with deep learning. Theoretically, these algorithms are only bounded to the space of functions with comparable outputs. However, information data does not flow as abundantly as deep learning methods, making them scale worse to compute. Combining both methods ought to
